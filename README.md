### Alder

Alders are part of the same family of trees as [Birch, Hazel, and Hornbeams (Betulaceae)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Betulaceae). They have interesting properties. They can be used as Nitrogren fixers. They are also medicinal. Red Alder, alond with Birch contains Betulin and Lupeol (useful for fighting tumors). Just as Birch and Willow do, it contains salicin. It is used in some cultures as part of a sacred  mixture used for praying with the pipe.
